    <statement>
        <p>Sketch the graph of a function <m>f(x)</m> that meets all of the following criteria. Be sure to scale your axes and label any important features of your graph.</p>
        <ol>
            <!-- Vertical Asymptote -->
                    <li><p><m>f(x)</m> has a vertical asymptote at <m>9</m>, but <m>\lim_{x\to 9^+} f(x)</m> is finite.</p></li>

    <answer>
        <p>Answers vary. Here are some things to check for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does your graph represent a function? If your graph fails the vertical line test, it is not a function. This means there is more than one point on the graph with the same <m>x</m>-value, which is not allowed!</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <!-- Vertical Asymptote Answers -->
                    <li><p>The graph should have a vertical asymptote at <m>x=9</m>. As the function approaches the vertical asymptote from the left, the function outputs should grow infinitely large in magnitude (either in the postive or negative <m>y</m>-direction). As the function approaches the vertical asymptote from the right, the function should bump straight into the vertical asymptote.</p></li>
            <!-- Removable Discontinuity -->
            <!-- Jump Discontinuity -->
            <!-- Vertical Asymptote Answers -->
            <!-- Removable Discontinuity -->
                    <li><p>The graph should approach the point <m>(8,-4)</m>, but there should be a removable discontinuity (hole) in the graph right at that point (indicated by an open circle). The actual value of the function at <m>x=8</m> should be <m>3</m>, so the point <m>(8,3)</m> should be included on the graph.</p></li>
            <!-- Jump Discontinuity -->
            <!-- Vertical Asymptote Answers -->
            <!-- Removable Discontinuity -->
            <!-- Jump Discontinuity -->
                    <li><p>There is a jump or infinite discontinuity at <m>x=6</m>, but the function approaches the point <m>(6,1)</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>6</m> from the right.</p></li>
