            <statement>
                <p>
                    Suppose a ladder of length <m>27</m> ft is leaning against a wall.  Then the base of the ladder is pulled away from the way at a rate of <m>3</m> feet/second.  What is the velocity of the top of the ladder when the base of the ladder is <m>7</m> feet away from the wall?
