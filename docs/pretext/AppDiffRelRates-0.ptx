            <statement>
                <p>
                    Suppose a ladder of length <m>26</m> ft is leaning against a wall.  Then the base of the ladder is pulled away from the way at a rate of <m>1</m> feet/second.  What is the velocity of the top of the ladder when the base of the ladder is <m>21</m> feet away from the wall?

            <answer>
                <p>
                    <m>-\frac{ 21 }{ \sqrt{235} }\approx -1.37</m> feet/second.
