    <statement>
        <p>
Suppose the position of an object in yards
is modeled by the following function.
<me>s(t)=t^{3} + 4 \, t^{2} + 7 \, t - 57</me>
        </p>
        <p>
Explain how to find the object's position, displacement,
velocity, speed, and acceleration at <m>5</m>
seconds. Use appropriate units for each.
